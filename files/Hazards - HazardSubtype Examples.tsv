HS660	Tensions and conflicts between political entities and/or social groups. These encompass civil unrests (e.g., strikes and protests), riots, demonstrations, disturbances and other public disorder events.
HS670	Political crisis is an urgent and structural threat, at the local, regional and/or national political levels, that necessitates urgent and alternative courses of action, and that impacts the city’s normal functioning (e.g., political deadlocks that impede the formation of a new local or regional government and/or the passing of local laws, or the death of a Mayor).
HS680	Corruption is understood as the widespread and deep-rooted abuse of entrusted power for private gain (by businesses and/or public officials) that undermines the rule of law and governance, and the trust of the population on the government.
HS690	Noncommunicable mental and physical diseases are chronic, non-infectious diseases, of long duration and of generally slow progression (e.g., cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases, cancers and diabetes). They are the result of the interplay of genetic pre-dispositions, lifestyle factors (e.g., tobacco use, overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, use of alcohol and unhealthy diets) and environmental and occupational exposures (to chemical, physical, biological, ergonomic and psychosocial hazards).
HS700	Chemical and physical health hazards include ingestion, dermal contact or aspiration of chemical and physical human-toxic substances (e.g., arsenic, asbestos, benzene and pesticides), exposure to electric and electronic waste (e.g., direct contact with lead and cadmium, and inhalation of toxic fumes), to nanomaterials and residuals from nanotechnological industry (e.g., carbon nanotubes) and to hormone disrupters (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, furans, mercury and persistent organic pollutants).

HS1020	Collapse of the city's built environment. It includes, amongst others, major damages on residential, commercial and public facilities and/or infrastructure.
HS1030	A housing crisis is the shortage of houses and/or of affordable houses. It may encompass disaster recovery cases where a substantial segment of the population needs to be relocated (e.g., earthquakes and tsunamis), or situations where the local population cannot afford housing costs (e.g., touristic fresidences too expensive for local population standards).
HS1040	It encompasses unplanned, uncontrolled and uncoordinated urbanisation schemes (e.g., the creation of informal areas and of informal settlements), often in hazard-prone areas, with inadequate waste disposal and lack of proper infrastructure facilities. It is often caused by rapid population growth.
HS1050	Breakdown or collapse of the health care system and/or of related facilities (e.g., public and private hospitals and clinics), causing major disruptions on the services.

It encompasses, besides food scarcity, natural and accidental events such as chemical, biological and foreign body food contamination.
HS1120	A water crisis is a significant decline in the availability of acceptable quantity and quality of drinking water for both population (maintaining health and livelihoods) and economic activities. Water distribution should be fair and non-discriminatory. It also encompasses competition and conflicts situations over access to water, not only by different sectors (e.g., agriculture, industry and tourism) but also across boundaries (e.g., conflicts in transboundary river basins).
HS1120	An energy crisis is often a significant reduction in the supply and/or a substantial price increase of energy resources (e.g., electricity, fuel and gas). It may be caused by market fluctuations, limitations on free trade, nationalisation of energy companies, shortages or disruptions on the operation of energy producers and distribution networks (e.g., due to accidents or sabotage) and natural conditions (e.g., a severe winter). In extreme cases, rationing measures may be applied that may cause panic buying and the ceasing of economic activities.
