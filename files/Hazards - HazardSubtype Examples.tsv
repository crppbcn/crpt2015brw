HS110	This hazard subtype encompasses additional extreme meteorological conditions such as frost, freeze, snow, ice and severe fog events.
HS140	Wildfires are unplanned vegetation fires. They can be due to natural causes (e.g., lightning), or by arson, explosion or accident. This subtype encompasses both land (bush, brush, grassland, scrub and pasture) and forest fires.
HS160	Earthquakes are the result of sudden movements of blocks of the Earth’s crust along geological faults.
HS170	Rockfall is the falling of newly detached mass of rock of any dimension from a cliff or down a very steep slope, caused by factors such as ice wedging, root growth, ground shaking or erosion.
HS180	A landslide is a moderate to rapid soil or debris movement, that includes phenomena such as mudflows, mudslides and debris flows.
HS190	Avalanche is a mass of snow, ice, debris and/or rocks, flowing and sliding rapidly down a steep slope. There is a dintinction between snow and debris avalanche.
HS200	The transformation of water-saturated soil from a solid state to a liquid state caused by an earthquake. Liquefaction reduces the strength and stiness of soil causing heavy structures (e.g., buildings) to sink and light structures (e.g., underground pipes and tanks), to rise up to the ground surface.
HS210	Subsidence events encompass sudden subsidence (e.g., formation of sinkholes) and long-lasting subsidence events.
HS220	This subtype hazard encompasses hazardous volcanic activity that occur during eruptions, such as lava and pyroclastic flows and the ejection of pyroclastic material/tephra (e.g., lapilli, volcanic bomb, volcanic block, etc) and poisonous gases; as well as volcanic activity that occurs in-between eruptions (e.g., lahar and hydrothermal explosions).
HS280	Floods may be classified as flash (sudden floods caused by intense rainfall, the breach of landslide dams or the failure of artificial systems such as embankments, pipelines, dams and dikes), fluvial, groundwater, pluvial/overland and coastal floods (including storm surges). This subtype also encompasses floods caused by glacial lake outbursts and ice jam floods.

HS510	Deforestation, overgrazing, uncontrolled logging, acid rain, erosion and sedimentation processes, desertification and poor agricultural practices can further contribute to land degradation. Contaminated and degraded soils may become unsuitable for agricultural and other economic activities, having consequences for the environment and the population depending on them.
HS520	Water physical changes, such as elevated temperature, discoloration, turbidity, siltation, depletion of oxygen (anoxia), as well as salt-water intrusion and acidification are also encompassed in water body's contamination. Natural phenomena such as volcanoes, algae blooms, storms and earthquakes may also cause major changes in water quality.
HS530	Air pollution is the introduction of particulates, biological molecules, or other harmful materials into Earth's atmosphere, causing health issues and contributing to photochemical smog and acid rain, corrosion of buildings and damaging of trees and crops.

The most common pollutants both for indoor and outdoor air are particulate matters, nitrogen dioxides, sulphur dioxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, heavy metals and ground level ozone. Air pollution comes from both anthropogenic (e.g., industry, waste incinerators, motor vehicles) and natural sources (e.g., volcanic activity, methane from livestock, dust from regions with little or no vegetation).
HS540	Erosion is the natural temporary or permanent removal of soil or rock materials by the effect of rainfall (e.g., on riverbanks), wind, moving ice, and of infiltrating water that dissolves rock (e.g., in limestone and young volcanic ash geological formations). Human activities intensify natural erosion (e.g., deforestation and intensive agriculture). Coastal erosion further includes erosion due to the action of tides and sea waves.
HS560	Sediment transport and deposition may lead to the turbidity, siltation and eutrophication of water bodies, and to the destruction of aquatic and terrain habitats. Change in coastal morphology can result in land boundary disputes.
HS570	Degradation of biodiversity, species extinction, major changes on species distribution, and ecosystem collapse that result in severely depleted resources for industry, fishing, forestry and other economic activities, and on irreversible consequences for the environment and for the humans dependent on it. It can be caused by erosion, desertification, pollution,   deforestation, poor agricultural practice.
