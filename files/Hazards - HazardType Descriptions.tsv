HTCODE	Description	Htype
HT10	This hazard subtype comprises all epidemic or pandemic outbreaks of human infectious diseases. These include viral, bacterial, parasitic, fungal and Prion diseases.	Epidemic and Pandemic
HT20	This subtype includes pervasive influx and development of insects, parasites, plants or animals affecting crops, humans, animals, fishes, vegetation, stored food and materials, as well as epidemic events on animals and plants that affect ecosystems and the livestock and agricultural sectors.	Infestation
HT30	An extended period of unusually low precipitation that produces shortage of water for people, animals and plants. The degree of precipitation reduction that constitutes a drought varies by locality, climate and environmental sector.	Drought
HT40	Extreme temperature events comprise cold waves (periods of abnormally cold weather that may be aggravated by high winds) and heat waves (periods of abnormally hot and/or unusually humid weather).	Extreme Temperature
HT50	This hazard subtype encompasses additional extreme meteorological conditions such as frost, freeze, snow, ice and severe fog events.	Additional Extreme Meteorological Conditions
HT60	Wildfires are unplanned vegetation fires. They can be due to natural causes (e.g., lightning), or by arson, explosion or accident. This subtype encompasses both land (bush, brush, grassland, scrub and pasture) and forest fires.	Wildfire
HT70	Earthquakes are the results of sudden movements of blocks of the Earth’s crust along geological faults.	Earthquake
HT80	The mass movement hazard subtype encompasses both dry and wet mass movements. Rock falls, landslides, avalanches, liquefaction and subsidence events are considered.	Mass Movement
HT90	This subtype hazard encompasses hazardous volcanic activity that occur during eruptions, such as lava and pyroclastic flows and the ejection of pyroclastic material/tephra (e.g., lapilli, volcanic bomb, volcanic block, etc) and poisonous gases; as well as volcanic activity that occurs in-between eruptions (e.g., lahar and hydrothermal explosions).	Volcanic Activity
HT100	Floods may be classified as flash (sudden floods caused by intense rainfall, the breach of landslide dams or the failure of artificial systems such as embankments, pipelines, dams and dikes), fluvial, groundwater, pluvial/overland and coastal floods (including storm surges). This subtype also encompasses floods caused by glacial lake outbursts and ice jam floods.	Flood
HT110	The storm’s subtype includes tropical (e.g., cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons), extra-tropical (e.g., European winter/windstorm and Nor’easter), as well as geomagnetic and local storms. Local storms encompass, amongst others, electrical storms or thunderstorms, rainstorms, windstorms, snowstorms and blizzard, tornadoes and dust and sandstorms.	Storm
HT120	High waves in ocean or in semi- or fully-enclosed bodies of water, such as lakes or bays, that may damage boats and coastal infrastructure, contributing to flooding and erosion. They are usually generated by strong winds (e.g., ocean swells and rogue waves and seiches) or by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or landslides (e.g., tsunamis).	Wave Action
HT130	The rise of the level of the water in the sea due to thermal expansion caused by the warming of the oceans and by the melting of land-based ice.	Sea-Level Rise
HT140	Radiation comprises both natural and man-induced contamination of the environment (usually indoor air, soil and water bodies) with radioactive isotopes (e.g., radon, uranium and plutonium).	Radiation
HT150	Water-soil contamination is usually caused by the presence of chemicals, solvents, pesticides, pathogens, heavy metals, or other physical alterations in the natural soil or water environment. The sources are often industrial activities, mining, agriculture and livestock practices and improper disposal of solid waste, of old war ammunitions, and of industrial and hazardous waste and sewage.	Water-Soil Contamination
HT160	molecules, or other harmful materials into Earth's atmosphere, causing health issues and contributing to photochemical smog and acid rain, corrosion of buildings and damaging of trees and crops. It encompasses both slow or gradual and rapid onset air pollution events. The most common pollutants both for indoor and outdoor air are particulate matters, nitrogen dioxides, sulphur dioxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, heavy metals and ground level ozone. Air pollution comes from both anthropogenic (e.g., industry, waste incinerators, motor vehicles) and natural sources (e.g., volcanic activity, methane from livestock, dust from regions with little or no vegetation).	Air Pollution
HT170	Erosion and sedimentation transport and deposition on inland and coastal sites.	Erosion and Sedimentation Processes
HT180	Degradation of biodiversity, species extinction, major changes on species distribution, and ecosystem collapse that result in severely depleted resources for industry, fishing, forestry and other economic activities, and on irreversible consequences for the environment and for the humans dependent on it. It can be caused by erosion, desertification, pollution,   deforestation, poor agricultural practice.	Biodiversity Loss and Ecosystem Degradation
HT190	Economic hazards encompass, amongst others, national and regional economic crisis (e.g., inflation and disruptions on import or export of goods) and the escalation of economic and resource nationalisation or privatisation that affect the city, discontinuities on economic activities and businesses, and the excessive unemployment or informal employment rate at local level.	Economic Hazard
HT200	Cultural hazards encompass, amongst others, the destruction of cultural heritage and symbols, and tensions between different ethnic groups.	Cultural Hazard
HT210	Mass population migration is understood as the movement of people, in and out of the city, with the intention of settling in, temporarily or permanently.   It includes mass refugees movements, economic, labour, political and cultural migration and both voluntary and forced migration.	Mass Population Migration
HT220	Political hazards include but are not limited to tensions between political entities and between political entities and social groups (e.g., disturbances, strikes and protests), political crisis that impact the city's normal functioning (e.g., political deadlocks) and widespread corruption.	Political Hazard
HT230	Non-transmissible physical and chemical health hazards and diseases attributed to a combination of lifestyle factors, genetic pre-dispositions and environmental and occupational exposure to hazardous substances (e.g., asbestos, nanomaterials, heavy metals chemicals and toxic fumes). It includes both physical and mental chronic diseases.	Health Hazard
HT240	The subtype crime encompasses events such as waves of violent personal crimes, waves of crimes against property, spread organised crime and illicit trade, and crimes against humanity. Overspread crime in a near-by region or country may have important impacts on the city.	Crime
HT250	Cyber-attacks are offensive maneuvers, employed by individuals or organisations, directed at computers or other devices, or attacks where computers or other devices are integral to the offence. These include hacking, massive fraud and data theft, espionage and sabotage, etc.	Cyber-attack
HT260	Armed or violent conflicts that affect the city, including revolutions, ethnic conflicts and wars. An armed conflict in a near-by region or country may have important impacts on the city.	Armed/Violent Conflict
HT270	Terrorism is the systematic use of terror, through violent acts or false alarms, exploiting human fear, as a way of trying to achieve political, ethnical, economic and/or religious goals. It may encompass biological, chemical, radiological or bomb attacks, hijacking, shootings, murders.	Terrorism
HT280	Industrial and mining incidents encompass events such as the collapse, fire, explosion and primary radiation release from these sites and facilities, including the collapse of residual industrial and mining dams and landfills. It may happen due to accidents, negligence, incompetence, or has a consequence of another hazard (e.g., earthquakes). It further comprises chemical spills, gas leaks, oil spills, gas flaring and the poisoning of the environment due to industrial activities.	Industrial and Mining Incident
HT290	Non-industrial incidents encompass explosions and fires on non-industrial settings, as well as transport incidents on land, air and water (including the transport of hazardous material). The impact of near-Earth objects and space debris is also taken into account.	Non-Industrial Incident
HT310	Failure of infrastructure’ is a major infrastructure breakdown with system-wide implications, usually due to the chronic failure of adequately investing in, upgrading or securing infrastructure systems. It can also be the consequence of natural or technological hazards, accident, human error or equipment malfunction. It comprises major disruptions and the breakdown of basic infrastructure, such as water, energy, solid waste, wastewater and communication systems and the collapse of transport systems; the collapse of buildings and urban structures; the breakdown of the governance, health, education, emergency and rescue, safety and justice, financial and business logistic systems. Housing crisis and rapid urbanisation are also encompassed in this hazard subtype.	Failure of Infrastructure
HT320	It encompasses food, water and energy critical shortages, as well as instabilities in quantity and/or quality of the resource(s) that disrupt the city's functions. Discontinuities in both availability (i.e., in production, distribution or trade) and on the access to the resource(s) in terms of affordability or allocation are considered. Situations where stocks of these goods/services are available in the city, but due to high prices, the majority of the population or businesses do not have access to them, are also considered in this hazard subtype.
