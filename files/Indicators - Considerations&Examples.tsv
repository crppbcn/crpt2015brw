Indicator	Type	ORDER	Description
1.1	General Consideration(s)	10	All sources of electricity supply should be included in the assessment (e.g. city network, generators, solar panels, windmills, etc.).
1.1.1	Consideration(s)	20	Note that there different types of distribution system design: radial, loop or grid. It is important to consider if individual sources are connected to the main network. This influences the coverage and potential spare capacity of the system, as well as the resilience of the network in terms of redundancy.
1.1.1	Consideration(s)	30	Coverage data can be given in terms of fraction of the population with access to electricity in relation to total population, or regarding area of the city covered by the service.
1.1.1	Consideration(s)	40	For spare capacity provision, the answer should consider if the current system can accommodate the anticipated growth in demand within the planned future.
1.1.1	Example(s)	50	The population with access to any form of supply can be 100%; however, only 80% can be connected to the municipal network, whilst the remaining are individual/alternative sources such as generators or solar panels.
1.1.1	Example(s)	60	The spare capacity can come from different sources, such as additional capacity of the actual municipal network, or individual/alternative sources with the possibility to feed back into the main grid.
1.1.2	Consideration(s)	70	The different levels of jurisdiction of the local government over the different components of the system can be considered separately.

1.5.4.1	Example(s)	1550	A city that has 50% of its population with television at home, and the other 50% with access to it via communal facilities, would have a 100% coverage of this medium.
1.5.4.1	Example(s)	1560	There are cases where radio stations are broadcasted from public loudspeakers at commercial centers, reaching a greater percentage of the population.
1.5.4.2	Consideration(s)	1570	The different levels of jurisdiction of the local government over the different components of the system can be considered separately.
1.5.4.2	Consideration(s)	1580	This entails all relevant local government entities, and their competences to perform the management of institutional, operational and infrastructural aspects of the television and radio operators, including the coordination of the different stakeholders.

1.5.4.3	Consideration(s)	1620	The answer should take into account the local context in terms of 'normal circumstances', and how eventual disruptions can affect the usual functioning of the network(s).
1.5.4.3	Example(s)	1630	Areas where free-to-air television channels reach but signal is not strong enough in order to provide clear image and sound should be considered as not having satisfactory signal levels.
1.5.4.4	Consideration(s)	1640	A plan usually contains the definition of vision and objectives, roles and resources, institutional and technical arrangements and, ideally, associated financing means.
1.5.4.4	Consideration(s)	1650	This entails all relevant local government entities and the coordination and engagement of the different stakeholders. The evaluation of available funding options (public and/or private) is of particular relevance for the economic sustainability of the plan.
1.5.4.4	Consideration(s)	1660	The developments can include institutional (e.g. new policies), operational (e.g. enhance coordination with different channels) and/or infrastructural (e.g. extension of the network coverage) measures.
1.5.4.4	Consideration(s)	1670	Take into account the relevance of regional and national level development plans in the local context and select the most appropriate spatial level for which the plan was developed.
1.5.4.4	Example(s)	1680	A national plan soon to be implemented, encompassing the installation of new TV broadcasting antennas in newly-developed areas in the country, which will provide coverage to a previously unattended neighbourhood of the city, would be categorised as "developed but not implemented", and the "national" scale should be selected.
1.5.4.4	Example(s)	1690	A plan that does not include the elements cited in the description, or if the plan is still in its conceptual or feasibility study stage, will be considered as 'under development'.
1.5.4.5	Consideration(s)	1700	A contingency plan is usually drawn on a risk assessment, and defines preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery measures in case of emergencies. It commonly assigns and defines roles and responsibilities, communication strategies, technical procedures, and, ideally, includes associated financing means. It is often multi-sectoral, but particularities regarding the television and radio networks should be explicit.
1.5.4.5	Consideration(s)	1710	The plan can include the use of alternative means of ensuring appropriate signal strenght, such as mobile antennas, or other means of communicating with the population in case TV/radio systems are non-operational.

1.6.1	Consideration(s)	1810	For spare capacity provision, the answer should consider if the current system can accommodate the anticipated growth in demand within the planned future.
1.6.1	Example(s)	1820	If 25% of the population has access to septic tanks and the remaining 75% is connected to the municipal network, the population with access to improved sanitation facilities will be 100%.
1.6.2	Consideration(s)	1830	Consider wastewater treatment as the process that improves and purifies the water, removing some or all of the contaminants, transforming it into an effluent that can be reused or returned to the water cycle with minimal environmental impact.
1.6.2	Consideration(s)	1840	The percentage should be obtained by dividing the amount of the wastewater being evaluated by the total amount of wastewater collected.
1.6.2	Consideration(s)	1850	Large waste generators are those that produce significant quantities of non-hazardous and/or hazardous waste (e.g. industries, hospitals, construction companies, laboratories, etc.).
1.6.2	Consideration(s)	1860	For spare capacity provision, the answer should consider if the current system can accommodate the anticipated growth in demand within the planned future.
1.6.3	Consideration(s)	1870	The different levels of jurisdiction of the local government over the different components of the system can be considered separately.
1.6.3	Consideration(s)	1880	This entails all relevant local government entities, and their competences to perform the management of institutional, operational and infrastructural aspects of the wastewater system, including the coordination of the different stakeholders.
1.6.3	Example(s)	1890	A city can 'fully control and operate' a municipal wastewater collection system while only 'exerting influence' over a private company operating a wastewater treatment plant.
1.6.4	Consideration(s)	1900	The wastewater collection system should provide a reliable and regular service preventing service interruptions and failures that can result in overflows or discharges of untreated wastewater.
1.6.4	Consideration(s)	1910	The assessment should consider number of disruptions and corresponding times, as well as sensitive network components which are more likely to cause interruptions.
1.6.4	Consideration(s)	1920	The answer should take into account the local context in terms of ´normal circumstances´, and how eventual disruptions can affect the usual functioning of the city.
1.6.4	Example(s)	1930	A city where the wastewater collection system is obstructed for several days in a year, causing overflows that affect the quality of life of the population and public health, should be considered as 'significant disruptions'.
1.6.4	Example(s)	1940	If the failure of a lift station in the wastewater collection network does not compromise the functioning of the system because it is possible to redirect the sewage to an alternative lift station, the level of impact chosen should be 'no major disruptions'.
1.6.5	Consideration(s)	1950	A plan usually contains the definition of vision and objectives, roles and resources, institutional and technical arrangements and, ideally, associated financing means.
1.6.5	Consideration(s)	1960	This entails all relevant local government entities and the coordination and engagement of the different stakeholders. The evaluation of available funding options (public and/or private) is of particular relevance for the economic sustainability of the plan.
1.6.5	Consideration(s)	1970	This entails all relevant local government bodies (such as infrastructure planning, policy-making, system operation). The evaluation of existing funding options (public and/or private) is of particular relevance for the economic sustainability of the investment. The government should coordinate actions and engage the different stakeholders.
1.6.5	Example(s)	1980	A development plan put in place to build improved communal sanitation facilities in dwellings where there is no wastewater collection, but with no means to monitor its efficiency, is categorised as 'under implementation'.
1.6.5	Example(s)	1990	A plan that does not include the elements cited in the description, or if the plan is still in its conceptual or feasibility study stage, will be considered as 'under development'.
1.6.6	Consideration(s)	2000	A contingency plan is usually drawn on a risk assessment, and defines preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery measures in case of emergencies. It commonly assigns and defines roles and responsibilities, communication strategies, technical procedures, and, ideally, includes associated financing means. It is often multi-sectoral, but particularities regarding the wastewater network should be explicit.
1.6.6	Consideration(s)	2010	Take into account the relevance of regional and national level contingency plans in the local context and select the most appropriate spatial level for which the plan was developed.
1.6.6	Example(s)	2020	If a plan has been elaborated and it has established the need to build an emergency tank in the municipal wastewater treatment plant but the city has not taken any measures to pursue this, then it is considered as 'developed but not implemented'.
1.6.6	Example(s)	2030	If the only available document is a national plan, but the relevant local actors have not been informed and responsibilities assigned, it should be considered as 'developed but not implemented', and the 'national' level should be selected.
1.7	General Consideration(s)	2040	Drinking water is the water used for domestic purposes, including cooking, drinking and personal hygiene that complies with World Health Organisation (WHO) or any other applicable water quality standards.
1.7	General Consideration(s)	2050	Access to drinking water means that the drinking water source is maximum one kilometre away from its place of use and that it is possible to obtain twenty litres per member of a household per day. All sources of drinking water, improved (i.e., protected from outside contamination) and unimproved (i.e., non-protected from outside contamination), should be included in the assessment.
1.7	General Consideration(s)	2060	Consider piped networks (e.g. public taps, standpipes, individual taps located on the user's household, dwelling, plot or yard) and non-piped/alternative sources (e.g. boreholes, dug wells, springs, rainwater collection and surface sources such as rivers, dams, lakes, ponds, streams, canals or irrigation channels).
1.7.1	Consideration(s)	2070	Population data can be given in terms of the percentage of the considered population in relation to the total population.
1.7.1	Consideration(s)	2080	For spare capacity provision, the answer should consider if the current system can accommodate the anticipated growth in demand within the planned future. Take into consideration the existence of storage facilities.
1.7.1	Example(s)	2090	The population with access to any form of supply can be 100%; 80% are connected to the water supply piped network, whilst 35% have access to alternative sources of drinking water such as bore holes or springs. Therefore, 15% of the population uses both types of sources and 20% only alternative ones.
1.7.1	Example(s)	2100	If the coverage of the water supply system is not 100% because part of the municipality is located in a difficult access area and the city does not have funds to create a specific water distribution system for it, specify the 'economic' and 'geographical/environmental' reasons.
1.7.1	Example(s)	2110	The total amount of population with access to any source of drinking water can be 70%, because of 'economic' and 'social/cultural' reasons, as 20% cannot afford the service and 10% live more than a kilometre away from the water source.
1.7.2	Consideration(s)	2120	The different levels of jurisdiction of the local government over the different components of the system can be considered separately.
1.7.2	Consideration(s)	2130	This entails all relevant local government entities, and their competences to perform the management of institutional, operational and infrastructural aspects of the waster supply, including the coordination of the different stakeholders.
1.7.2	Example(s)	2140	A city with a local public enterprise and a private supplier providing water can have different levels of jurisdiction over each one. For the former, it would normally 'fully controls and operates' the entity, whilst for the latter it 'exerts influence' over the decision-making process with no involvement in the operation.
1.7.2	Example(s)	2150	A municipality 'fully controls and operates' the piped network, whilst it only 'monitors' the quality of the water of a lake from where one specific community gets its water supply.
1.7.3	Consideration(s)	2160	Interruptions to the flow of drinking water at the tap or source can be generated either through intermittent sources or be the result of engineering inefficiencies on the collection, treatment, storage or water distribution systems. The existence of service reservoirs, that is, reservoirs that store treated water, allows fluctuations in demand to be accommodated and therefore are also of relevance.
1.7.3	Consideration(s)	2170	The assessment should consider number of disruptions and corresponding times, as well as sensitive network components which are more likely to cause interruptions on the flow supply and/or on the quality of the drinking water.
1.7.3	Consideration(s)	2180	The answer should take into account the local context in terms of 'normal circumstances', and how eventual disruptions can affect the usual functioning of the city.
1.7.3	Example(s)	2190	A city with peak demand exceeding the flow capacity of the transmission mains but that still remains fully operational due to individual storing capacities, can consider this as a 'no major disruption'. On the other hand, in the case an eventual service disruption of a few hours incurs in substantial setbacks, the answer would be 'significant disruptions'.
1.7.3	Example(s)	2200	Seasonal disruptions can occur during dry seasons due to source water level reduction and to competition with other usages such as irrigation.
1.7.3	Example(s)	2210	A seasonal disruption can occur in the rainy season, when heavy rain results on the clogging of water sources, inducing the overflow of open dumps and sanitation facilities. This can cause contamination and high turbidity of the sources' water, rendering it untreatable for consumption.
1.7.4	Consideration(s)	2220	A plan usually contains the definition of vision and objectives, roles and resources, institutional and technical arrangements and, ideally, associated financing means.
1.7.4	Consideration(s)	2230	This entails all relevant local government entities and the coordination and engagement of the different stakeholders. The evaluation of available funding options (public and/or private) is of particular relevance for the economic sustainability of the plan.
1.7.4	Consideration(s)	2240	The developments can encompass institutional (e.g. new policies), operational (e.g. better demand management) and/or infrastructural (e.g. extension of the piped network) measures.
1.7.4	Consideration(s)	2250	Consider any improvements on the processes involved in the collection, treatment, storage and/or distribution of drinking water.
1.7.4	Consideration(s)	2260	Take into account the relevance of regional and national level development plans in the local context and select the most appropriate spatial level for which the plan was developed.
1.7.4	Example(s)	2270	A city currently performing improvement of its water supply distribution system, by relocating the intakes and the establishment of protection zones, based on the development plan, whilst feeding back newly-acquired information into the plan, has its plan categorised as 'under implementation, with regular monitoring and revision'.
1.7.4	Example(s)	2280	A city developing a strategy to monitor its drinking water quality through sampling and analysis will have a plan considered as 'under development', and the 'local' scale should be selected.
1.7.4	Example(s)	2290	A plan that does not include the elements cited in the description, or if the plan is still in its conceptual or feasibility study stage, will be considered as 'under development'.
1.7.5	Consideration(s)	2300	A contingency plan is usually drawn on a risk assessment, and defines preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery measures in case of emergencies. It commonly assigns and defines roles and responsibilities, communication strategies, technical procedures, and, ideally, includes associated financing means. It is often multi-sectoral, but particularities regarding the water supply system should be explicit.
1.7.5	Consideration(s)	2310	The strategy can consider the restoration of the affected operators or the provision of alternative sources and/or of distribution networks.
1.7.5	Consideration(s)	2320	Take into account the relevance of regional and national level contingency plans in the local context and select the most appropriate spatial level for which the plan was developed.
1.7.5	Example(s)	2330	If the plan has been elaborated, the alternatives have been verified and confirmed, and defined roles and responsibilities have been assigned and informed, it is considered as 'implemented' and the 'local' level should be selected.
1.7.5	Example(s)	2340	If a contingency plan has been elaborated, with the communication strategy and technical procedures in case of a major failure in the piped distribution network tested in drills, by using a near-by lake and tanked trucks as the alternative drinking water source, select 'implemented, periodically monitored and reviewed'.

2.1.2	Sub - Consideration(s)	2470	Consider social housing as all affordable housing intended for vulnerable population regulated by government policies that define different types of tenancy arrangements. These arrangements may include rental housing, which can be owned and managed by the government and/or by non-profit organizations, purchase of housing at a reduced value and a combination of the previous dispositions.
2.1.2	Sub - Consideration(s)	2480	Informal areas are residential, commercial and/or industrial areas where people have no security of tenure over the land or buildings they use, with modalities ranging from squatting to informal rental arrangement. The neighbourhoods usually lack, or are cut off from, basic services and city infrastructure and the buildings may not comply with current planning and building regulations.
2.1.3	Consideration(s)	2490	Data regarding public open spaces can be given in relative numbers (i.e., as a percentage in relation to the city area), or in absolute numbers (i.e., area occupied).
2.1.3	Consideration(s)	2500	Public open spaces are all places publicly owned or of public use, accessible and enjoyable by all for free and without profit motive. Public spaces encompass a range of different settings, such as streets, sidewalks, bicycle lanes, squares, play grounds, open areas of public facilities, green spaces (e.g., gardens, parks, conservation areas).
2.1.4	Consideration(s)	2510	Land tenure is the relationship, whether legally or customarily defined, among people, as individuals or groups, with respect to land, determining how land is used, possessed, sold, or in other ways disposed.
2.1.4	Consideration(s)	2520	The different types of land tenure usually include private (land rights are hold by a private party), communal/collective (a certain community shares the land rights, where each member has a right to use the land independently), open access (there is no restrictions to the usage of the resources of the land) and state (land rights are assigned to a government authority).
2.1.5	Consideration(s)	2530	The different levels of jurisdiction of the local government (e.g. issuing regulation, granting permits and licenses, inspecting usage conditions, etc.) over the different components of the land usage should be considered separately.

2.1.5	Consideration(s)	2550	If relevant, please differentiate local government jurisdiction over commercial, industrial, public facilities, housing and public infrastructure.
2.1.5	Example(s)	2560	When a local government assigns permits for commercial activities in a certain part of the city, in accordance with the land-use city plan, and that it performs regular inspections, it is considered that the local governments 'exerts control'.
2.1.5	Example(s)	2570	If a local government is only responsible for monitoring and reporting the land-use permits issued by the national ministry of public works, it is considered that the local government only 'monitors'.
2.1.6	Consideration(s)	2580	The plan should define land-use options, determining land set aside for parks and open space, residential areas, commercial and industrial uses, mixed-use areas, etc. It should also take into consideration socio-economic and environmental aspects.
2.1.6	Consideration(s)	2590	A plan usually contains the definition of vision and objectives, roles and resources, institutional and technical arrangements and, ideally, associated financing means.
2.1.6	Consideration(s)	2600	This entails all relevant local government entities and the coordination and engagement of the different stakeholders. The evaluation of available funding options (public and/or private) is of particular relevance for the economic sustainability of the plan.
2.1.6	Consideration(s)	2610	Take into account the relevance of regional and national level plans in the local context and select the most appropriate spatial level for which the plan was developed.
2.1.6	Example(s)	2620	A city with a land use plan where it determines the admissible land use and density for future developments promoting mixed land use, diversity and better connectivity, that is reviewed and monitored regularly, would have a plan 'under implementation, with regular monitoring and revision' at the 'local' level.
2.1.6	Example(s)	2630	A plan that does not include the elements cited in the description, or if the plan is still in its conceptual or feasibility study stage, will be considered as 'under development'.

8.4.1.5	Consideration(s)	8260	The plan can include special operating procedures and/or measures to re-establish affected operators and infrastructure.
8.4.1.5	Consideration(s)	8270	Take into account the relevance of regional and national level contingency plans in the local context and select the most appropriate spatial level for which the plan was developed.
8.4.1.5	Example(s)	8280	If a contingency plan has been developed at a national level for all airports for the screening of passengers flying from countries with a virus disease outbreak, ensuring sufficient number of trained staff, performing drills and updating the plan, then it is considered as 'implemented, periodically monitored and reviewed' developed at a 'national' scale.
8.4.1.5	Example(s)	8290	If the only available document is a regional plan for all the region airports, relevant local actors have been informed and responsibilities assigned, and alternatives have been verified, it should be considered as 'implemented', and the 'regional' level should be selected.
8.5	General Consideration(s)	8300	Cable transport entails transport modes that use cables as their basic means of moving. It includes aerial lifts (e.g. aerial tramway, chairlift, ski lift, etc.) and surface lifts (e.g. cable car, funicular, etc.). There is a particular interest in aerial lifts, since these represent a distinct set of conditions that require specific management measures.
8.5.1.1	Consideration(s)	8310	Information regarding carrying capacity can be given, for example, in terms of capacity per direction per hour, or the total daily capacity of the network.
8.5.1.1	Consideration(s)	8320	Spare capacity data is only applicable to lines used for public transport.
8.5.1.2	Consideration(s)	8330	The different levels of jurisdiction of the local government over the different components of the system can be considered separately.
8.5.1.2	Consideration(s)	8340	This entails all relevant local government entities, and their competences to perform the management of institutional, operational and infrastructural aspects of the cable transport network, including the coordination of the different stakeholders.
8.5.1.2	Example(s)	8350	A city can 'fully control and operate' a cable car that connects a community to a bus terminal, whilst being 'informed' over the operation of privately-run sky lifts.
8.5.1.3	Consideration(s)	8360	The answer should take into account the local context in terms of 'normal circumstances', and how eventual disruptions can affect the usual functioning of the system.
8.5.1.3	Consideration(s)	8370	For service frequency, consider lines used for public transport, following specific routes.
8.5.1.3	Example(s)	8380	If services are jeopardised by constant power shortages, the option 'significant disruptions' should be selected.
8.5.1.4	Consideration(s)	8390	A plan usually contains the definition of vision and objectives, roles and resources, institutional and technical arrangements and, ideally, associated financing means.
8.5.1.4	Consideration(s)	8400	This entails all relevant local government entities and the coordination and engagement of the different stakeholders. The evaluation of available funding options (public and/or private) is of particular relevance for the economic sustainability of the plan.
8.5.1.4	Consideration(s)	8410	A transport master plan is usually multi-modal, i.e., considers the different transport modes within the city and how they can connect, interact and complement each other's operations.
8.5.1.4	Consideration(s)	8420	The developments can consist of institutional (e.g. new comfort standards), operational (e.g. increase frequency in operation) and/or infrastructural (e.g. extension of an existing line) measures.
8.5.1.4	Example(s)	8430	A city currently in the process of enhancing the synergy of its different transport modes, by improving its connection infrastructure and synchronising timetables, has a plan 'under implementation'.
8.5.1.4	Example(s)	8440	If the government is looking at sources for funding the implementation of a development plan, this plan will be considered as 'under development'.
8.5.1.5	Consideration(s)	8450	A contingency plan is usually drawn on a risk assessment, and defines preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery measures in case of emergencies. It commonly assigns and defines roles and responsibilities, communication strategies, technical procedures, and, ideally, includes associated financing means. It is often multi-sectoral, but particularities regarding cable transport network should be explicit.
8.5.1.5	Consideration(s)	8460	The plan can include measures to recover the affected operators, and/or alternative means to provide transport for the population.
8.5.1.5	Consideration(s)	8470	Take into account the relevance of regional and national level contingency plans in the local context and select the most appropriate spatial level for which the plan was developed.
8.5.1.5	Example(s)	8480	If the plan has been elaborated, alternatives to evacuate people have been verified, and defined roles and responsibilities have been assigned and informed, it is considered as 'implemented'.
8.5.1.5	Example(s)	8490	If the only available document is a national plan, but the relevant local actors have not been informed and responsibilities assigned, it should be considered as 'developed but not implemented', and the 'national' level should be selected.
7.3	General Consideration(s)	8500	There is a particular interest in understanding the population's involvement in knowledge sharing and capacity building initiatives, due to their significance for disaster risk preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery.
7.3	General Consideration(s)	8510	The population's access to technical means of communication is relevant in order to inform people on the relevant hazards, specificities of the local area, existent technology and on the procedures in case of a disaster, as well as to receive information and feedback from them in case of emergencies.
7.3	General Consideration(s)	8520	Traditional or local knowledge encompasses all local, traditional and indigenous understandings, know-how, skills and practices that are developed, adjusted and passed on from generation to generation within a community or social group. It is generally based on the accumulation of empirical observations and on the interactions with the surrounding environment.
7.3	General Consideration(s)	8530	Consider capacity building as long-term processes, which include top-down and bottom-up initiatives that empower social actors and provide them with knowledge, skills and competencies in order to increase their social, economic and environmental resilience.
7.3	General Consideration(s)	8540	The language(s) in which information is broadcasted and capacity building initiatives are organised should be taken into account, as not all population may be fluent on the utilised idiom(s) (e.g. recent migrants and tourists).
7.3	General Consideration(s)	8550	Stakeholders refer to all parties that influence or are influenced by the assessed initiatives, such as social actors (population and civil society organisations), private sector organisations and academia, from the local to the international level, operating in the city.
7.3.1	Consideration(s)	8560	Data can be given in relative numbers (i.e. as a percentage in relation to the total population), or in absolute numbers (i.e. total amount) and can be specified by gender.
7.3.1	Consideration(s)	8570	Technical means of communication include devices for receiving and transmitting information (radio, television, internet, fixed and mobile phones). Please note that people may have access to these through indirect means such as communal facilities or relatives.
7.3.1	Consideration(s)	8580	Consider here population that cannot receive information nor communicate back in case of emergencies (i.e. with no access to phone, internet, television or radio), as well as population that is able to receive information (via TV or radio receivers), but does not have technical devices (internet, phone, radio transmitter) to respond.
7.3.1	Example(s)	8590	A city where 80% of people have a television, and the other 20% live in a neighbourhood that only has two communal televisions and a radio transmitter, but the internal communication strategy allows everyone to be informed about the broadcasted information, can consider that its entire population has access to technical means of communication.
7.3.1	Example(s)	8600	A city can have 10% of its population with 'no access to information transmitting devices' because there is an isolated neighbourhood where phone and internet signals do not reach the area.
7.3.2	Consideration(s)	8610	The different contingency plans encompassing different hazards and/or areas can be considered separately.
7.3.2	Consideration(s)	8620	Data can be given in terms of population or area; in relative numbers (i.e. as a percentage in relation to the total population or area of the city), or in absolute numbers (i.e. total amount of people or area covered).
7.3.2	Example(s)	8630	The population coverage of a flood contingency plan may be only 85%, if one of the neighbourhoods (with 15% of the city's inhabitants) is not located on flood-prone area.
7.3.3	Sub - Consideration(s)	8640	The different contingency plans encompassing different hazards and/or areas can be considered separately.
7.3.3	Sub - Consideration(s)	8650	Consider that all relevant stakeholders participate in the process when they are involved on the decision-making and their ideas and opinions are taken into consideration.
7.3.3	Sub - Consideration(s)	8660	The different contingency plans encompassing different hazards and/or areas can be considered separately.
7.3.3	Sub - Consideration(s)	8670	Only take into consideration specific traditional and/or local knowledge about hazards, vulnerability and climate risk (e.g. the understanding of sudden lowering of the sea level implies heading rapidly inland as a sign of the occurrence of a tsunami) that feed into disaster and adaptation planning.
7.3.3	Sub - Consideration(s)	8680	The different contingency plans encompassing different hazards and/or areas can be considered separately.
7.3.3	Sub - Consideration(s)	8690	A contingency plan usually defines people who are responsible for conducting specific activities (e.g. coordinate evacuation) during the occurrence of disasters.
7.3.3	Sub - Consideration(s)	8700	Take into account local government that uses communication channels and tools in order to inform the population about particular information on contingency plans such as standard procedures and/or hazards relevant for the city.
7.3.3	Sub - Consideration(s)	8710	Consider cases where new information is collected (e.g. local and/or scientific records on disasters and primary environmental challenges, profiles of vulnerable areas and risk maps) and frequently integrated into the database.
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8720	Programmes can include mass casualty and disaster management, hazard mapping and programmes on earthquake vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure.
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8730	Target groups can be students, representatives of private sector, local communities, vulnerable groups, professionals (e.g. engineers, architects and planners), decision-makers (e.g. local and sub-local governments and community leaders), emergency and rescue teams, volunteers and mass public.
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8740	Consider as awareness initiatives all tools (e.g. media campaigns, informal education methodologies and formal school-based interventions) directed to extent population’s knowledge on disaster risks regarding its values on preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery.
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8750	Consider as training all organised activities (e.g. workshops, drills, testing of equipment) that aim to provide practical experience and skills, as well as instructions about effective actions during and after emergencies.
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8760	Data can be given in relative numbers (i.e. as a percentage in relation to the total population), or in absolute numbers (i.e. population trained).
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8770	Include in the assessment people that have specialised training on emergency preparedness and mitigation such as evacuation procedures (e.g. 'fire wardens' in case of fire) or in basic first aid.
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8780	The different contingency plans and/or emergency drills can be considered separately.
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8790	Data can be given in relative numbers (i.e. as a percentage in relation to the total population), or in absolute numbers (i.e. total amount of people that have participated in an emergency drill).
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8800	The different emergency situation can be considered separately.
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8810	Take into consideration all relevant disasters that occurred in the city in the last decades.
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8820	Data can be given in relative numbers (i.e. as a percentage in relation to the total population), or in absolute numbers (i.e. total amount).
7.3.4	Sub - Consideration(s)	8830	Consider all relevant knowledge-sharing platforms, of top-down and bottom-up initiatives, as well as collaboration between cities or communities (twin cities, city-to-city sharing initiatives) in order to exchange best practices and applicable knowledge.
7.3.4	Sub - Example(s)	8840	These can include, for example, contact lists of people with specialised skills (e.g., physicians, electricians and plumbers) to be used by the local authorities in case of need.
